# Summary

This project reproduce the result of in paper [1] with Mindquantum. We construct the variational quantum algorithm for singular value decomposition (VQSVD) circuits and reproduce demo about image compression/reconstruction, the difference loss between original matrix and reconstructed one under different ranks is illustrated. More details can be found in the toturial `main.ipynb`.
