# QPI (Quantum Papers Implementation)

## Introduction

This repository includes some implementation of quantum related papers based on [MindSpore/mindquantum](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindquantum). Papers[1-4] are chosen from [2022 Quantum Selected Paper Reproduction Challenge](https://hiq.huaweicloud.com/consult/events/detail/2022-Paper-Reproduction-Challenge), which hold by HiQ quantum computing.

These reproduced codes have merged to `research` branch of gitee repository `[MindSpore/mindquantum` as well, see [here](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindquantum/tree/research/paper_recurrence/2023).
