# Quantum Witnessing

## Summary

This project reproduce the result of Fig.5 in paper [1] with Mindquantum. The details cover preparing 3-bits REW(real equally weighted) states, bi-separable 3-bits system, variational quantum algorithm (VQA), entanglement witnessing (EW), quantum machine learning (QML) and so on. More details can be found in the toturial `main.ipynb`.
